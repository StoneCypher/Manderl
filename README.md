Manderl
=======

Manderl - a Mailchimp [Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/) interface for Erlang

This module provides a simple, limited interface for [Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/), the API mail interface from [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/).



Status
------

This is a new library and is not considered to be usable yet, let alone production ready.  (In fact, it doesn't even work yet.)



Dependencies
------------

This library requires [scutil](https://github.com/StoneCypher/scutil.github.com/) and [hackney](https://github.com/benoitc/hackney), and uses [PropEr](http://proper.softlab.ntua.gr/).  These can be auto-installed from the [rebar](https://github.com/basho/rebar) script.

-------------------

`Manderl` is MIT licensed, because viral licenses and newspeak language modification are evil.  Free is ***only*** free when it's free for everyone.
