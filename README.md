This module provides a simple, limited interface for [Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/), the API mail interface from [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/).



Status

This is a new library and is not considered to be usable yet, let alone production ready.  (In fact, it doesn't even work yet.)

`Manderl` is MIT licensed, because viral licenses and newspeak language modification are evil.  Free is ***only*** free when it's free for everyone.
